CGS Level 1 agents should make 1 call back attempt to the end user to either provide assistance or gather the required information needed for escalation. 

In the event the call is unsuccessful, meaning the agent was unable to speak with the end user, the agent should document in the incident the attempt was made to contact the user and the item will now be escalated to either the FAST or Rentalman team.

**Phone calls** should be escalated as normal.

During normal business hours for FAST support, (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM EST), warm transfer to FAST Support URI at 877-862-7849 option 2 FAST after a ticket is created. (do not escalate to Wireless or Phone Vendor, i.e. Verizon) 

Save the ticket under the agents name if not already done, then place it back into a logged status and escalate to FAST Support URI

**Quick actions are available for most FAST issues and should be used by Level 1**. Under Action Menu select FAST for Dispatch issues, and FAST – Samsung for HHD issues, then select the best option.
