The Query system, or also referred to as CPAT, is the system used to pull data most commonly by Excel spreadsheets that have macro(s). They are also called Refresh Files referring to the fact that the macro in the spreadsheet says “Refresh”.
Laptops should have ODBC installed on their laptops for access to the query system to work properly, which is available through the Software Center if necessary for re/install.

See referencing Kbases for install, configuration and troubleshooting.

Issues with the spreadsheet and excel errors generating from them should be directed back to the original owner of the spreadsheet.
