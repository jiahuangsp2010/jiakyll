## Sophos – Accessing Support Tool
 
 
A support tool has been created for Sophos and has been added to the desktop of the ITSupport servers.  This tool is a RDP application and if needed a new RDP icon can be generated, you’ll need to open this link in Google Chrome so that it gives you the option to download the RDP shortcut, IE will just open a connection without a save option.
 
1. Open Google Chrome and navigate to https://sophosmgmt/RDWeb/Pages/en-US/default.aspx
 
    a. If you get a message that the page is not secure just click Advanced then Proceed to Site Anyways
 
2. Login ID is domain followed by user ID (ex – URNT\wdaniel1) and your UR network password

3. Click the SafeGuard Support Tool icon
 
4. An RDP shortcut will download
 
5. Click the arrow next the file then click Show in Folder
 
6. Copy the file to a convenient location such as your Desktop
 
7. For clarity it’s recommended to rename the file to “Sophos Support Tool”
 
From there you can launch the icon, login with your network ID and password it and the application window will launch after the remote connection is made.
 
If you get a message that access was denied when attempting to access the tool reach out to Bryan Ricks (**bricks@ur.com**) 
 
Finally, a copy of the RDP icon is also saved on FS3 and \\FS3\Software\ITSupport\Sophos\
