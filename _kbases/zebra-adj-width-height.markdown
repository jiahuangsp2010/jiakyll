If the Barcode labels are not centered, follow the steps below

**Correcting width:**

```
01. Press green button until you get 5 flashes and release.
    a.  5 flashes would be 1 flash, 2 more flashes, 3 more flashes, 4 more flashes and then 
        5 more flashes for a total of 15 flashes.

02. Labels will print out with numbers on them. When the label has number 1.89 press the 
    green button 1 time to select. (See attached example "Sticker width.pdf")
```

**Correcting Height:**

 
```
01. Press green button until you get 2 flashes and release.
    a.  2 flashes would be 1 flash and then 2 more flashes for a total of 3 flashes.

02. Labels will print out with what looks like a medical heart rate chart 
    (or mountains depending on what kind of person you are). 
    (See attached example "Sticker height.pdf")

03. It will stop when the printer resets the height.
