### Shipping Instructions for IT Asset Returns

Please use the following instructions to ship your assets to the **HOBI**.  

1. If the original box and original packing material are not available, please be sure to use a good sturdy box for shipping, preferably from a UPS or Purolator store if no sturdy box or packing material is available.     
**Please do NOT use boxes from U-Haul, Lowes, Home Depot, Wal-Mart etc. as these boxes are not sturdy and will be damaged during shipment.** 
2. Please wrap the asset in a minimum of three (3) inches of bubble wrap padding with an additional minimum 2 inches of padding surrounding a computer or printer to avoid any type of damaging during shipment.     
3. Computers:  please ship the asset through a shipper that can be tracked (such as UPS or Purolator) Send the assets either next day or second day.  Ground deliveries may cause undue delay.  Record the shippers tracking number in case the unit gets lost in shipment.    
4. Printers:  Either recycle the toner cartridge or place the cartridge inside of a plastic bag and reinsert back into the printer to avoid any toner spillage during shipping.  Place the printer on a pallet and ship as freight.  
5. Please ship the IT asset to one of the following addresses, or reach out to
