Starting on 1/19/2017, the 3 call back rule, on **incidents emailed** in for **Rentalman** issues, to gather user information and provide assistance has been modified.


**CGS** Level 1 agents should make 1 call back attempt to the end user to either provide assistance or gather the required information needed for escalation. In the event the call is unsuccessful, meaning the agent was unable to speak with the end user, the agent should document in the incident the attempt was made to contact the user and the item will now be escalated to either the FAST or Rentalman team.

Save the ticket under the agents name if not already done, then place it back into a logged status and escalate to the respective team.


For Rentalman phone calls, Rentalman L2 will need to have the following details when possible from L1 when escalating a ticket:


1. Rentalman User ID of the user with the concern
