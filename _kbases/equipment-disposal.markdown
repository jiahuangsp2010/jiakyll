The website can be launched through Rentalman at 2>71>52 and should use the SSO login.

When a user submits an equipment disposal it will automatically send to the appropriate approver:

If OEC value is greater than $5K approval will be needed from Fleet Director

- Email goes to first Fleet Manager listed for their region in 9>7

If Cat/Class is of Vehicle type approval will be needed from Vehicle Fleet

- Email will go to vehicles@ur.com

If the user input a Claim number or if EQPMASFL is populated approval will be needed from Risk Management (based on request type).

- Email will go to RPP@ur.com

If EQPMASFL/Equipment TYPE = ‘S’ (Sub-rent), approval will be needed from Fixed Assets.

- Email will go to Fixed Assets CAMG@ur.com


If the approver says that they did not receive the email to approve, whomever sent the request will need to “Resend Request” by using the dropdown on the Equipment Disposal website.

- Support does not have the access to re-send the request.

At this time there is no way to approve without the email, as the link in the email contains a token which takes the approver directly to the equipment in question.  Once the token has been used it is no longer available.
