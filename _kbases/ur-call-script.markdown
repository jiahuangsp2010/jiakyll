**Greeting: **
“Thank you for calling the United Rentals Support Center, my name is <NAME>, are you calling about a new or existing ticket?

**Closing:**
“Here is your Incident number in case you need to call us back on this issue.” ; “Is there anything else I can assist you with <Caller's First Name>?” ; “Thank you for calling the “United Rentals Support Center”

Assign any escalated tickets (regardless of date and time) to **Support 1.5.** 

**Exceptions:**
**Any business impacting issue** (i.e. work is not able to get done until it is fixed) **or outage** needs to be reported immediately.  Please use KBase Tip# 1407 to promptly and properly escalate issues to PC Level 2 or Rentalman Support.

**FAST** - Tickets should be immediately transferred to the appropriate FAST team as callers (or tickets in the event that the caller is unavailable) should be warm transferred.

**NDI** - Like FAST, these users require a warm transfer to the team at the time of the issue.  These users are generally having site issues, which a delay in ticket could also cause a delay to the user/site.

**Rentalman Level 2** – If the ticket is warm transferred to Rentalman Level 2, the tickets also need to be transferred at the time of the call to prevent any confusion.
Any time a caller is not warm transferred (after hours) the ticket should be escalated to Rentalman Level 2 or if a work stoppage, KB 10752 - Contact after hours support for Rentalman, PC Level 2, and FAST Support
