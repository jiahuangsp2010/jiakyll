<h3 id="shipping-instructions-for-asset-repair">Shipping Instructions for Asset Repair</h3>

<p>The following instructions must be adhered to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you have called the Support Desk and they have created a repair ticket for you. <strong><em>WE WILL NOT KNOW YOUR MACHINE IS IN FOR REPAIR WITHOUT A TICKET.</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please use the original box or the boxes you received your new computer in to return your old asset.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Please do NOT use boxes from U-Haul, Lowes, Home Depot, Wal-Mart etc… as these boxes are not sturdy and will be damaged during shipment which will also damage the asset.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write your support ticket number on the outside of the box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If needed, please wrap the asset in a minimum of three (3) inches of bubble wrap padding with an additional minimum 2 inches of padding surrounding a computer to avoid any type of damage during shipment.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Proper packaging is very important. If we take the precautions to ensure that the asset is packaged properly, the shipping company will be liable for any damage and UR will be reimbursed. However, if the damages are caused by shipper error such as; improper packaging or no insurance, we will only be reimbursed for the shipping charges.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Please ship the asset through an approved shipper that can be tracked (such as UPS or Purolator) and insure the asset as follows: Laptops: $1500, Desktops: $600. Send the asset/s ground and record the shipper’s tracking number in case the unit gets lost in shipment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All locations should ship to the US Asset Management Depot:</p>
