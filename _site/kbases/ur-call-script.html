			<h2>UR Call Scripts (notes)</h2>

<p>**Greeting: **
“Thank you for calling the United Rentals Support Center, my name is <NAME>, are you calling about a new or existing ticket?</NAME></p>

<p><strong>Closing:</strong>
“Here is your Incident number in case you need to call us back on this issue.” ; “Is there anything else I can assist you with &lt;Caller’s First Name&gt;?” ; “Thank you for calling the “United Rentals Support Center”</p>

<p>Assign any escalated tickets (regardless of date and time) to <strong>Support 1.5.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong>
<strong>Any business impacting issue</strong> (i.e. work is not able to get done until it is fixed) <strong>or outage</strong> needs to be reported immediately.  Please use KBase Tip# 1407 to promptly and properly escalate issues to PC Level 2 or Rentalman Support.</p>

<ul>
  <li>12216 - What tickets should I escalate to Provisioning, Changes or Asset Management</li>
  <li>11628 - Escalating a Reimage/Repair to Repair-Deployment</li>
  <li>10944 - Escalation Procedures for the Support Center – Rentalman</li>
  <li>10743 - Escalation Procedures for the Support Center - FAST</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FAST</strong> - Tickets should be immediately transferred to the appropriate FAST team as callers (or tickets in the event that the caller is unavailable) should be warm transferred.</p>

<p><strong>NDI</strong> - Like FAST, these users require a warm transfer to the team at the time of the issue.  These users are generally having site issues, which a delay in ticket could also cause a delay to the user/site.</p>

<p><strong>Rentalman Level 2</strong> – If the ticket is warm transferred to Rentalman Level 2, the tickets also need to be transferred at the time of the call to prevent any confusion.
Any time a caller is not warm transferred (after hours) the ticket should be escalated to Rentalman Level 2 or if a work stoppage, KB 10752 - Contact after hours support for Rentalman, PC Level 2, and FAST Support</p>
