			<h2>Rentalman - Only - Print Issue (10664)</h2>

<p>User can’t print from RM, but can still print Local Documents i.e. Office Products from Windows like Email, Word, Excel, etc.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Have the user hit F11 from any main Rentalman menu and inform you of the Printer ‘Sts’ (Status)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Sts is END, user can use Option 1 to Start, if Sts is MSGW (Message Waiting), the writer needs to be Ended first, then can be started. (see following details on how to End the writer).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Two of the main reasons a printer status gores to MSGW are Paper Jam, or Printer running out of Paper. Have user check the physical printer itself to confirm it is ready.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Obtain the Network Printer name in Question i.e. UR091P22</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From Command line, you will type the command WW, then a space, then UR###* (### will be the location number). Hit <enter></enter></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find the Printer in question. If in MSGW status start here, if in END status skip to step 5</p>

    <p>a. Most users can hit F11 from any main Rentalman Menu at the location level and do these same steps on their own without involving Support.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE: the user may need to adjust their Assistance Level to accomplish this:</strong></p>

<p>Within the F11 screen (Work with All Printers) User will Press F21 ( Shift + F9 )</p>

<p>Change or verify that the assistance level is 2 (Intermediate) then press enter and continue.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use option 4 next to the printer in question, then F4</p>

    <p>NOTE: do not press enter between the 4 and F4</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change *CNTRLD to *IMMED and hit press Enter</p>

    <p>a. It should return the user to the Work with all Printers, with confirmation of the printer ending</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hit F5 to refresh the screen, it should now say END for Sts, if not refresh again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When in END status, Use Option 1 to restart the writer and press Enter twice</p>

    <p>a. After Entering you should see the confirmation stating it was submitted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>F5 to Refresh and Sts should show *STR (Started)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verify that the printer is printing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If not, use option 8 next to the printer to work with output queue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check if there is anything waiting to print</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press F5 to refresh the screen</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you see the status of pending, continue to press F5 several times.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If the job Prints, Issue resolved</p>

<p>If the job does not go thru and stays at PND (Pending) or goes to MSGW (Message Waiting) again proceed to the next step</p>

<p>NOTE: This is as far as the user can go with F11, the next Steps are done from the Support side.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Obtain the IP address for the Printer in question.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. You can use one of two methods to get the IP address</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>i. Use http://rm.ur.com/printers.html and locate the IP by printer name

ii. On the command line type the following command:

A. WRKDEVD (then a space) then the printer name, and press Enter

B. Chose Opt 2 to Change, press Enter and page down twice

C. You should now see the IP listed under Remote Location

D. Press F3 until you are at a screen with a command line at the bottom

E. On Command line type Call QCMD, Hit &lt;Enter&gt;

F. Type in PING ‘IP Address’ (make sure to include the beginning, and ending apostrophes), 
and press Enter
            
Note: If there are no replies, or several unsuccessful attempts, it is not a good ping.  
The printer may not be connected to the network, has a bad cable – Or – the IP address 
is different on the printer.

G. Verify that the IP Address is correct on the printer (see IP verification K-Base).
            
Note: If the IP is correct on the printer and in Rentalman, yet it is still not pinging, 
you will need to perform Network Connectivity Troubleshooting (see additional K-Bases)
